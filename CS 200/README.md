# [CS 200: Data Structures](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2020-2021/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/CS-COMPUTER-SCIENCE/200/CS-200)
### Description
This course continues the introduction to computer programming from previous courses. This course covers the development and use of data structures in computer science and object-oriented software development. Using a modern programming language, students learn about the implementation and use of abstract data types. Students are expected to apply and augment the programming knowledge acquired in previous courses to the task of developing more complex works. Topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, common trees and tree algorithms, graphs and traversal algorithms, and common algorithms related to these structures. Students will also learn to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms that they implement over the course of the semester.
### Learning Objectives
- Implement and differentiate between abstract data types and their associated operations
- Differentiate between FIFO and LIFO structures and how they are implemented
- Explain the concepts behind trees and implement several variations of tree structures
- Apply hashing and recognize its advantages in data structure implementation
- Explain how algorithm efficiency is measured, and calculate it for simple functions or segments of code
- Implement, trace, measure the efficiency of, and compare and contrast between sorting algorithms
