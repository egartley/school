# [CS 200: Data Structures](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2019-2020/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/CS-COMPUTER-SCIENCE/200/CS-200)
### Description
This course continues the introduction to computer programming begun in CS 102 or IT 102. This course covers the development and use of data structures in computer science and object-oriented software development. Using a modern programming language, students learn about the implementation and use of abstract data types. Students are expected to apply and augment the programming knowledge acquired in previous courses to the task of developing more complex works. Topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, common trees and tree algorithms, graphs and traversal algorithms, and common algorithms related to these structures. Students will also learn to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms that they implement over the course of the semester.
