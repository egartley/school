# [CS 366: Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2019-2020/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/CS-COMPUTER-SCIENCE/300/CS-366)
### Description
This course provides students with the fundamental techniques and strategies used in the design of algorithms, including proper selection of data structures, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, greedy methods, and backtracking. The course also exposes students to the analysis of algorithms using methods to estimate run-time performance. The theory of NP-completeness is discussed, along with heuristic methods for constructing algorithms for "hard problems." Numerous case studies give students perspective into how algorithm problems arise in the real world.
