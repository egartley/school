# [MATH 150: Applied Discrete Mathematics](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/2019-2020/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/MATH-MATHEMATICS/100/MATH-150)
### Description
This course introduces the student to mathematical concepts that are essential to the computing world. The emphasis is how these topics are applied as opposed to the theoretical development of the topics. Topics include congruence and modular arithmetic, counting techniques, relations and functions, sets, logic, probability, graphs, trees, and graph coloring. Applications include RSA cryptography, SQL, hash tables and register allocation.

- Draw Venn diagrams to represent the relationship between two or more sets
- Understand the relationship between logic and set theory
- Use logic and set theory to write proper queries in SQL
- Apply the multiplication rule, permutations and combinations to appropriate combinatorics (counting) problems
- Use Venn diagrams and combinatorics to answer questions involving inclusion-exclusion problems
- Understand the basic probability axioms and how to calculate expected value
- Understand conditional probability and independence
- Understand the difference between relations and functions
- Determine whether or not a relation is reflexive, symmetric or transitive
- Work with modular arithmetic
- Understand and apply the basic definitions of graph theory, including trees
- Locate Euler circuits and paths when they exist
