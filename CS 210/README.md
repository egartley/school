# [CS 210: Software Design](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2020-2021/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/CS-COMPUTER-SCIENCE/200/CS-210)
### Description
This course introduces software design concepts, standard software design notations, design patterns and software architectures. Design notations will include data flow-oriented, objectoriented, data-oriented, and real-time approaches. Modularization of design patterns for software construction will be explored. Students will design and implement portions of a software system to demonstrate the use of design notations and design patterns.
### Learning Objectives
- Correctly apply polymorphism and interfaces
- Demonstrate correct use of generics
- Correctly implement exceptions
- Apply one or more design notation(s) to design a system
- Select the appropriate design notation for describing a system
- Describe the trade-offs involved in selecting a design pattern for a functionality
- Select the appropriate design pattern for carrying out described functionality
- Describe the trade-offs involved in selecting a software architecture for an application
- Select the appropriate software architecture for a system
