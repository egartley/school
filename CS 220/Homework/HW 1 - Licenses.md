1. Which type of license ensures that all derivatives of the work will always have the same license?  
	**A copyleft license, such as GPL 3**
2. Which type of license allows derivatives of the work to apply a different license to their new version?  
	**Permissive licenses, like Apache 2**
3. Which type provides the most freedoms to recipients?  
	**Permissive, because recipients are able to change the license, while they can't under copyleft**
4. Which ensures that all recipients have the same rights on all derivations?  
	**Copyleft, since derivatives must use the same license**
5. Which is easier for a company to work with because they do not have to regularly audit their commits to ensure they are in compliance with licenses?  
	**Permissive, because otherwise audits would be required to ensure compliance with copyleft as copyleft must have the same license**
6. Which does not require a contributor to supply a copyright notice and a statement of how their contribution is licensed?  
	**Copyleft**
7. MIT License (Expat), is a classic permissive license. GPLv3 (not LGPLv3) is a classic CopyLeft license. Look both up on [TLDRLegal](https://tldrlegal.com/). What makes the GPLv3 license a CopyLeft license?  
	**GPL 3 is copyleft because any modifications must also be licensed under GPL 3 (cannot sublicense but MIT can sublicense)**
8. What is Linux licensed under? What type of license is it?  
	**It's licensed under GPLv2, which is copyleft**
9. Read the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). Linux requires its contributors to sign-off on this certificate for each contribution. What could go wrong if they didn't?  
	**There could be legal consequences, especially since Linux is such a large and well-managed project, likely with expensive lawyers at the ready**
10. Read this [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/pjcozzi/4d1ab2166519de7ba41b). Why must it mention the MIT license?  
	**Since MIT is permissive, there can be sublicensing, so you need to specify which license you're using as opposed to copyleft where the license is inferred**
11. If you find code online that does not have a license, what can you do with it? Do you think that was the intent of the author? What can you do about it?  
	**Legally, you can't do anything with it since they have copyright. This was probably not the intent of the author, since intuitively you'd think not including a license would mean anyone can do whatever with it. If you wanted to legally use the code, you would have to contact the author and ask them to include a license. Otherwise, using the code that doesn't have a license would technically be illegal.**
