# [CS 102: Introduction to Programming](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2019-2020/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/CS-COMPUTER-SCIENCE/100/CS-102)
### Description
Covers problem solving with programming. Students learn to apply fundamental imperative, procedural constructs to solve common programming problems, as well as the beginnings of object oriented programming (e.g., defining classes, instantiating objects, using objects, and using application programmer's interfaces). Students learn to design and develop small programs using a procedural, imperative programming language and appropriate analysis, design, and testing techniques.
### Learning Objectives
- Install, configure, and use a development environment for the language(s) used
- Demonstrate ability to apply appropriate computing tools to solve problems, describe data, and/or analyze models
- Demonstrate the use of variables, types, selection, iteration, functions, classes, objects, and standard API in the language(s) taught
- Design, implement, and test small programs (computational artifacts) to solve computing problems
- Demonstrate programming conventions appropriate for the language used
- Identify the following computing principles, their purpose, and manifestation in programming: abstraction, algorithm, generalization, simplification
