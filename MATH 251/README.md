# [MATH 251: Advanced Discrete Mathematics](https://wne.smartcatalogiq.com/2020-2021/Catalogue/Undergraduate-Courses/MATH-MATHEMATICS/200/MATH-251)
### Description
This is a study of proof techniques and the writing of mathematical arguments in areas such as set theory, number theory, relations, and functions. Emphasis is placed on this theory as it relates to computer science and computer programming. Topics also include mathematical induction, recursive definitions, cardinality, and computability.
### Learning Objectives
- Ability to establish connections between real world phenomena and mathematical ideas
- Ability to solve problems by employing mathematical reasoning skills, using mathematical equations, or analyzing quantitative data
- Understand, interpret and negate mathematical statements
- Prove and disprove results using different methods such as disproof by counterexample, direct proof, proof by cases, proof by contrapositive, proof by contraction and mathematical induction
- Apply proof techniques in various areas such as set theory, number theory, graph theory, summations, function and relations
- Determine, with proof, whether a given set is finite, countably infinite or uncountable
- Understand and use the Cantor diagonalization process to show that a set is uncountable
- State the Halting Problem and describe its importance
